Day 1 - Hello? Hello, hello? Uh... hi! Ths is the first guy, just wanted to let ya know most of the employees haven't been getting payed and may want to get payed. Uh... We can't be having none of that so we've sort of... "modified" your office to help prevent that. Um on your desk you'll see a flashlight, a P.A. button, and a little camera interface. The flashlight and P.A. serve to ward off employees, flash the flashlight in their eyes or use the P.A. system to announce a fake layoff to scare them off. As far as I'm aware, either of those will work so just use one of them when the employees show up at either door. As for the cameras... well Chadward broke the only useful one the other day so really it's only use as of right now is for entertainment. Wait no, scratch that, there is actually a camera that you can use to reset the coffee machine and prevent it from breaking. You're genuinely addicted to that stuff to the point where I'm pretty sure you would [GAME END] if the machine went out. (Silence for 5-10 seconds). Uh, but yeah just don't pay them and stuff. Uh, goodbye. (Goes to hang up but call doesn't end) *Caller goes back to discord call* Hey guys, I'm back. *Insert a bunch of random league of legends callouts* *Ends with angrily smashing pc and call cutting*

Day 2 - Howdy? Howdy there pardner, uhhhh this the second guy. I'm just here to give you an update on the protocol regarding preventing the employees from getting payed. The gist of it is that they're starting to fight back. They're like a buncha jackrabbits locked up in a chest freezer! One of them employees started using sunglasses recently, besides being stupid it also prevents the flashlight from working on him. So instead of using the flashlight always use the P.A. system to threaten to fire him. In addition to that, one of the foreign employees we contracted abroad is also trying to get paid now. He doesn't speak or understand english so I doubt the P.A. will work on him, so instead just flash him with the flashlight and that should scare him away. Just to sum it up use the P.A. on the guy with the sunglasses and use the flashlight on the foreign guy. Erm, also in other news the manager of the building next to us has been getting mad at us for... reasons... so just be careful with that. Uh that should be it really. Make sure to use the appropriate measures to get rid of the employees and also don't forget the coffee. We cant have another incident at work. Alright I'll let you get back to your shift, happy working!
